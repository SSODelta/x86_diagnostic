## Basic tests
simple_var.c;             3;       Increments a variable three times.
simple_var2.c;            7;       Iterates x->2x+1 three times.
return_var.c;            47;       Declares an int and returns it.
simple_branch.c;         58;       Branches on variable equality.
array_index.c;           39;       Initializes a 4-element integer array and returns its sum.
array_write.c;           45;       Initializes a 4-element integer array, changes first index and returns its sum.
array_write2.c;          20;       Initializes a 4-element integer array, fills with first element and returns its sum.
array_write3.c;           1;       Initializes the array [1,2] and sets the second entry to the first entry and returns it.
array_write3_alt.c;      67;       Same as above but with {67,87} and other indices.
array_index_loop.c;      39;       Initializes a 4-element integer array and returns its sum using a loop.
array_bigint.c;      332557;       Initializes a 3-element integer array and returns its value treated as a base 256 bigint.
insertion_sort1.c;       15;       Sort an 11-element integer array.
insertion_sort1_alt.c;   15;       The same array but sorted.
insertion_sort1_eq.c;    20;       The same algorithm but the entire array is 5s.
insertion_sort2.c;       15;       Sort a 9-element integer array.
array_minimum1.c;         2;       Compute the minimum of an 11-element integer array.
array_minimum2.c;         5;       Compute the minimum of an 11-element integer array.
